I notice you had vegetable upma for breakfast instead of the recommended poha. \n\nWhile upma is a delicious and savory option, sticking to the prescribed diet is best for your health and wellness. Poha is a great choice for breakfast as it's a nutritious flatbread that can help stabilize blood sugar and provide sustained energy. \n\nI understand everyone has their food preferences, and upma is a tasty dish, but changing the meal plan without consulting the dietician can have disadvantages. The recommended diet is tailored to your health needs and provides specific benefits. \n\n**Ideal Response:**\n\nVarsha, I noticed you are having upma instead of the prescribed poha for breakfast. It's important to adhere to the diet plan because each meal is carefully chosen to support your health and wellness. \n\nPoha has unique nutritional benefits that contribute to the overall goals of your diet plan. Upma is a great dish, but we recommend avoiding it in this instance. Can you let me know why you chose upma over poha? \n\nRemember, every meal counts in maintaining a healthy diet!"
